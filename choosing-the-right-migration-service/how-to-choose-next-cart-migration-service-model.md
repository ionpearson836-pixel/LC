# How to Choose Next-Cart Migration Service Model

Choosing a migration provider is important, but the delivery model you choose usually matters more than the vendor name. Most outcomes are shaped by three practical factors:

* **How complex your store data is**
* **How much time and attention your team can realistically commit**
* **How much risk you can tolerate in mapping and validation**

Next-Cart offers three service models built around those realities: **Standard Migration, Managed Migration, and Custom Migration**.

### The simplest way to think about service models

A service model is a decision about **who owns execution** and **who absorbs complexity**.

* If your team wants control and can validate carefully, you usually want **Standard Migration**.
* If you want experts to run the process and reduce workload, you usually want **Managed Migration**.
* If your store has non-standard requirements that must be preserved accurately, you usually need **Custom Migration**, which includes custom handling through **Custom Jobs**.

If you are unsure how complex your data really is, **Demo Migration: What It Proves and How to Read Results** is the fastest way to replace assumptions with evidence.

### The three service models of Next-Cart

#### Standard Migration

**Standard Migration** is best for teams that want control, can dedicate time to review results, and have a fairly straightforward scope.

It is a “self-managed with expert support” model:

* You decide timing and iteration
* You own review and validation
* Experts are available to keep you unblocked and reduce guesswork

This is a strong fit when your data is mostly standard e-commerce data and your success criteria are clear.

#### Managed Migration

**Managed Migration** is best when execution workload and coordination risk are the main problems.

In this model:

* Next-Cart runs the standard migration flow on your behalf
* You stay involved in decisions and still review results
* The goal is to reduce internal burden and make validation more structured

Managed Migration is often the right step up when your timeline is tight, internal bandwidth is limited, or the cost of mistakes is high.

#### Custom Migration

**Custom Migration** is for stores where “moving standard data” is not enough.

Custom Migration equals **Managed Migration plus a Custom Job package** to address needs such as:

* custom-coded fields or non-standard data structures
* data living in third-party modules, plugins, or extensions that must be preserved
* transformations or special mapping rules needed to maintain meaning in the target cart
* special requests that require custom modifications to settings or migration behavior

If you suspect you have custom scope, **When Custom Job Is Required: Common Real-World Scenarios** will help you recognize the most common triggers before you commit to a plan.

### Decision signals that usually lead to the right choice

Use these signals to choose the right model without overthinking it.

You do not need to overthink the decision. These signals are usually enough.

**Choose Standard Migration when:**

* Your store's data is mostly standard products, customers, orders, and basic content
* You can dedicate time to review and validate the result carefully
* You want control over timing and the flexibility to iterate
* You want the option to upgrade later if the demo reveals edge cases

**Choose Managed Migration when:**

* You want to reduce workload and execution stress
* Your timeline is tight or coordination is difficult
* The risk of mistakes is costly, even if the data is not extreme
* You want an expert-led run with a clearer review structure

**Choose Custom Migration when:**

* Your store relies on third-party modules, custom fields, or non-standard data that must carry over
* You require transformations, filtering, or special mapping rules
* You cannot accept “close enough” for critical data behavior

If you are also trying to size the project realistically, **Entity Points Explained** clarifies how migration scope is estimated so you can choose the right plan without guessing.

#### A practical starting rule if you feel uncertain

If you cannot confidently pick a model today, do not force the decision with hypotheticals. Reduce uncertainty first.

A Demo Migration tends to reveal whether your store behaves like:

* a **Standard** project (clean mapping, predictable validation)
* a **Managed** project (mapping is fine, but you want experts to run execution)
* a **Custom** project (special cases appear quickly)

**Next-Cart insight**: most teams pick the wrong service model when they base the decision on record counts instead of risk signals. A demo using your most complex products and highest-value categories usually surfaces the truth quickly.

#### Conclusion

The best service model is the one that matches your store’s complexity and your team’s capacity, not the one that sounds most comprehensive.

If you are deciding between Standard, Managed, and Custom, a Demo Migration using your most complex products and highest-value categories is the most reliable way to choose with confidence. If you want a clearer interpretation and a faster path to the right plan, you can request an assisted demo by sharing a small sample dataset so the Next-Cart team can run the demo and provide a structured results summary.

And if you want immediate guidance on scope, risks, and which service model fits your desired outcome, **Live Chat** is a simple way to get expert input without turning the decision into a long back-and-forth.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I start with Standard Migration and upgrade to Custom Migration later?</strong></summary>

Absolutely! While it is possible to begin with Standard Migration and switch to Custom Migration afterward, we recommend a more cost-effective strategy.

Start with a Demo Migration to observe how your data performs in the target environment. If the demo uncovers high risks, limited internal resources, or specific custom needs, you can discuss and receive expert consultation via **Live Chat** to select the most suitable service model without the hassle of an upgrade.

This approach ensures a smoother, more informed migration process tailored to your needs.

<summary><strong>What is the difference between Managed Migration and Custom Migration?</strong></summary>

Managed services offer expert-led execution of standard migrations, ensuring a smooth, hassle-free transition.

When you need more tailored solutions, Custom services with Custom Jobs handle non-standard requirements like unique mapping rules, transformations, or plugin-driven data.&#x20;

<details>

<summary><strong>Do I still need to validate results if I choose Managed or Custom?</strong></summary>

Yes. The goal is to make validation easier and more reliable, not to eliminate it. Even with expert execution, you still want to review the areas most likely to impact customers and operations, such as product structure, variants, navigation, customers, orders, and URL continuity planning.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What are the most common signs that I need a Custom Migration?</strong></summary>

Common signals include data stored in third-party modules or custom fields, special transformation rules, and business-critical behaviors that must match precisely in the target store.

If you are unsure, **When Custom Job Is Required: Common Scenarios** is the most direct way to sanity-check your situation.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Is Managed Migration only for large stores?</strong></summary>

Not necessarily. Managed Migration is often chosen because of timeline pressure, limited internal bandwidth, or the cost of mistakes, not only because of store size.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How do I avoid choosing a service model based on guesswork?</strong></summary>

Use a Demo Migration as evidence. A small, representative demo tends to reveal whether your store behaves like a standard case or whether special handling and deeper guidance are needed.

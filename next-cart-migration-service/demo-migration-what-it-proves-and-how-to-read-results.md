# Demo Migration: What It Proves and How to Read Results

A Demo Migration is the safest way to evaluate a shopping cart migration before you commit budget, timelines, or a target platform decision. It turns assumptions into evidence by showing how your real store data is expected to appear and behave on the target cart.

This article explains what a Demo Migration is designed to prove, what it cannot prove, how to review results without overreacting to normal platform differences, and how the demo compares to the paid migration experience. It follows Next-Cart’s refined migration journey, where Demo Migration is the foundation of preparing for a shopping cart migration.

### What is a Demo Migration

A Demo Migration is a small, controlled migration run that transfers a limited sample of your data into the Target Store.

The goal is to evaluate quality using representative sample data and identify whether special handling or Custom Jobs may be needed.

In Next-Cart’s standard demo workflow, the demo migrates a limited sample to prove quality, commonly including up to:

* 10 Products
* 10 Customers
* 10 Orders
* 10 Blog Posts

You can complete Demo Migration in two ways:

* **Self-service demo:** you run the Demo Migration yourself, and reach out to Next-Cart’s 24/7 experts if results are unclear or unexpected.
* **Expert-assisted demo:** you provide sample data and ask Next-Cart to run the Demo Migration and review results with you.

**Important note**: Demo results and expert consultation are what you use to choose the right service model later.

#### How to choose a good demo sample

A random sample can create false confidence. A strong sample intentionally includes complexity, because complexity is where risk shows up first.

A high-quality demo sample typically includes:

* Best sellers
* Most complex products (highest variant or attribute complexity)
* A few high-value categories
* Products with important attributes or custom fields
* A short list of priority URLs

**Next-Cart insight**: teams get the most clarity when they include their hardest items on purpose. If the most complex products behave correctly in the target store, the rest of the catalog is usually less risky.

### What a Demo Migration is designed to prove

#### 1) Data compatibility and mapping direction

The demo helps you validate whether your data can translate into the target platform’s structure in a way that preserves meaning:

* Are product variants and options represented logically?
* Do categories and product relationships look reasonable?
* Do customers and orders appear coherent and usable?
* Do you see signs of data that may need special handling?

The goal is not perfect sameness. It is confirming you are on the right path and identifying what must be planned.

#### 2) The quality of outcomes for high-impact items

A demo is most useful when you test a representative sample that contains complexity on purpose, such as:

* best sellers with complex variants
* top categories that shape browsing paths
* a few support-relevant order scenarios
* any items that represent known edge cases (odd option naming, duplicate SKUs, messy attributes)

This is where you discover whether the target store will behave the way customers expect.

#### 3) Whether you may need special handling or Custom Jobs

The demo can reveal signals that standard capabilities may not preserve required behavior, such as:

* custom fields that drive storefront display or filtering
* third-party extension data that matters operationally
* non-standard structures that do not translate cleanly

This is often the point where Custom Jobs become visible, because standard mapping cannot reliably move data the standard platform model does not expose cleanly. If you suspect you have custom scope, **When Custom Job Is Required: Common Scenarios** will help you recognize common triggers early.

**Next-Cart insight**: a demo is not just a technical test. It is a scoping tool. It helps you avoid choosing the wrong level of help by showing whether Standard, Managed, or Custom is the right fit. If you are weighing those options, see **How to Choose Next-Cart Migration Service Model**.

### What a Demo Migration cannot prove

A demo is an assessment, not a full launch rehearsal. It typically cannot prove:

#### Full-store completeness

Because demo migrations are intentionally limited, you should not use demo totals to judge completeness for the entire store.

#### Final go-live readiness

Go-live readiness depends on full validation across your real scope, plus a plan for freshness near launch.

#### Custom data migration outcomes

If your project requires custom fields or third-party module data, that work is typically evaluated as a separate requirement and may require Custom Jobs.

That is why demo review should focus on representative complexity, not only “easy” records. To identify the full scope that best suits your needs, feel free to reach out for expert support and discussion via **Live Chat**.

### How to review Demo Migration results without misreading them

#### Step 1: Judge outcomes, not totals

Start with whether the target store looks and behaves plausibly for the sample:

* Do variants behave logically?
* Do products belong to the expected categories?
* Are the “important few” items represented correctly?

Totals matter later. The demo is about direction and quality signals.

#### Step 2: Separate platform differences from migration issues

Different platforms represent commerce differently. Some differences are normal:

* variant structures may be modeled differently
* discount rules may not translate 1:1
* categories and collections may work differently

Treat these as planning decisions unless they break buying behavior or operational usability.

#### Step 3: Identify whether the issue is mapping, scope, or capability

When you see something unexpected, classify it:

* Mapping decision: the meaning needs clearer translation
* Scope decision: the data type or behavior needs explicit inclusion or acceptance
* Capability gap: the target platform cannot represent the behavior the same way
* Custom requirement: the project needs Custom Jobs to preserve required behavior

This classification prevents panic and makes the next step obvious.

### How service models relate to Demo Migration

Demo Migration exists to help you choose the right service model with evidence.

#### Standard Migration

* You run migrations using the tool with expert guidance.
* Best when you want control and have capacity to operate and validate.

#### Managed Migration

* A Next-Cart's expert runs the migration end-to-end for you based on your needs.
* Best when you want to reduce internal workload and focus on validating outcomes.

#### Custom Migration

* One or more Custom Jobs are implemented into the tool for special requirements, then Next-Cart's expert will run the migration.
* Best when demo results reveal special handling needs that standard capabilities cannot cover.

All service models include 24/7 expert support. Service model selection usually becomes clear after demo results and requirement review.

#### Conclusion

A practical industry takeaway is that Demo Migration is not meant to be impressive. It is meant to be diagnostic. A good demo reveals mapping direction, platform fit signals, and where your store’s complexity lives, using a small but representative sample. When you review demo results through the lens of outcomes and decision categories (mapping, scope, capability, or custom requirement), you can move forward with confidence instead of guessing.

If you want to validate direction quickly, choose a demo sample that includes your real complexity, especially best sellers with tricky variants and your most important browsing paths. If you want an expert to run the demo with your sample and help interpret what the results mean for service model fit, reach out via Live Chat. Next-Cart can help you identify whether Standard Migration is sufficient, whether Managed Migration will reduce execution burden, or whether Custom Jobs are needed to preserve what matters.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>What’s included in the demo version and how does it differ from the full version?</strong></summary>

The demo is designed to evaluate results using limited sample data. It typically caps core record types (such as products, customers, orders, blog posts, and CMS pages) at a small number per run, applies a daily quota, and does not support background migration or custom data migration.

The full version removes these evaluation limits and supports full-scope migration based on your Entity Points Plan, with features such as background execution, Recent Data Migration, and Custom Jobs for custom requirements.

<details>

<summary><strong>What makes a demo sample “representative”?</strong></summary>

A representative sample includes the items most likely to expose problems: complex products, important categories, and any records tied to custom fields or third-party systems. The goal is to test risk, not average cases.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>If the demo looks wrong, does that mean the migration cannot work?</strong></summary>

Not necessarily. A demo is designed to surface what needs attention. Some issues point to configuration choices or mapping decisions, while others signal that custom scope exists and may require Custom Jobs.

If you need help interpreting what the demo is telling you, Live Chat is the fastest way to clarify the path forward without guessing.

<details>

<summary><strong>Does a Demo Migration prove SEO will be fully preserved?</strong></summary>

A demo can help you validate priorities and feasibility, but it does not guarantee every SEO edge case.

Treat it as a signal check: confirm priority pages, URL behavior, and redirect planning, then validate more deeply as you finalize go-live preparation.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>When should I choose an assisted demo instead of running it myself?</strong></summary>

Assisted demos are most useful when your store is complex, when SEO continuity is high-stakes, or when you suspect custom data behavior. The value is not volume. It is clearer interpretation and earlier scoping accuracy.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How many demos should I run before go-live?</strong></summary>

Run as many as you need to reduce uncertainty, especially when you change assumptions or adjust scope.

Many teams use an early demo to validate mapping behavior, then follow a repeatable validation mindset as they approach launch planning and recent data synchronization.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I close my browser during the migartion process</strong></summary>

Background execution is not available in the demo. In the paid experience, migrations can run in the background so you do not need to keep a browser session open throughout the process.

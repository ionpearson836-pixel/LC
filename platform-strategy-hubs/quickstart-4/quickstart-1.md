# Magento Data Model Differences: What Changes and Why It Matters

Magento (Adobe Commerce) migrations succeed when you preserve **meaning**, not just records. In Magento, meaning is often defined by product type behavior, attributes and attribute sets, multi-store scope rules, and URL continuity decisions.

This page explains the Magento-specific data model elements that most often change during a shopping cart migration and why those changes influence catalog behavior, discoverability, and launch readiness.

#### What is “different” about Magento’s model in practice?

Most eCommerce platforms store product data as a relatively fixed set of fields. Magento is built to be **highly configurable and extendable**, which is powerful but also means migration outcomes depend heavily on how your catalog is modeled and scoped. Magento projects often go off-track when teams treat “the database” as the deliverable, instead of treating **catalog behavior** as the deliverable.

Key areas where “structure” matters more than people expect:

* **Product types and relationships** (how buying behavior is modeled)
* **Attributes and attribute sets** (how product fields are defined and how discovery works)
* **Websites, stores, and store views** (how the same catalog differs across storefront contexts)
* **URL rewrites and redirects** (how SEO continuity is preserved)
* **Search and filtering dependencies** (discovery relies on attribute quality and configuration)

#### 1) Product types and catalog behavior

Magento supports multiple product types, including **simple, configurable, virtual, downloadable, bundle, and grouped**.

**Why it matters in a migration**

Product type is not just a label. It influences:

* **How customers choose options** (selection flow and what “a variation” means in the storefront)
* **How inventory is tracked** (what counts as a separate purchasable unit
* **How products are presented** (what appears as a single item vs a group with selectable choices)

If your source platform models **kits, bundles, or variations** differently, the mapping decision can change what customers see and how they buy.

**Practical planning examples**

* A “bundle” in one platform may behave like a curated set of required components, while Magento may represent the same intention using **bundle** or **grouped** products depending on whether components are optional, required, or separately priced.
* A platform that stores variations as separate products may require careful consolidation into a single Magento **configurable** product to keep selection behavior consistent.

The migration goal is to preserve purchase behavior so products do not merely exist in the target store, but still “work” the way customers expect.

#### 2) Attributes and attribute sets

Magento relies heavily on **attributes**, organized into **attribute sets** that function like templates for product records.

Magento’s EAV module exists to make entities configurable and extendable, which is part of why Magento can support rich, evolving catalogs.

**Why it matters in a migration**

In Magento, attributes are not just descriptions. They often drive:

* **Filtering and layered navigation**
* **Promotions and merchandising rules**
* **Comparisons and discoverability** (how customers find products via category browsing and search)

A common Magento reality is **attribute sprawl**. Migration planning should decide which attributes are essential, which are redundant, and which must be standardized to preserve storefront behavior.

**What “attribute sprawl” looks like**

* Multiple attributes representing the same concept (for example, “Color,” “Colour,” “Primary Color”).
* Attributes populated inconsistently across product lines, leading to empty filters, confusing facets, or poor category browsing experiences.
* Attribute sets that evolved over time without a clear product-family strategy, causing two similar products to appear “structured” differently.

**Planning mindset**

Treat attributes and attribute sets as _storefront structure_, not mere data fields. If customers rely on filtering, browsing, and comparison, attribute quality becomes a core migration deliverable, not an afterthought.

#### 3) Multi-store hierarchy: websites, stores, and store views

Magento installations have a hierarchy of **websites, stores, and store views** that controls scope.

**Why it matters in a migration**

* A single installation can serve **multiple storefronts** with different root categories and sometimes different base URLs.
* Migration mapping must account for where catalog entities apply in that hierarchy (what differs by storefront vs what is shared).

**Planning examples**

* A global brand with regional storefronts may need different category trees, pricing, language, or availability rules by storefront context.
* Multi-store is not just “multiple themes.” It affects how the same catalog is scoped, presented, and validated across contexts.

This is one reason Magento migrations often require more deliberate validation planning: the same product can behave differently depending on scope decisions.

#### 4) SEO continuity through URL rewrites and redirects

Magento has a URL rewrites tool that can create permanent redirects (301) to preserve SEO value when URLs change.

**Why it matters in a migration**

* URL continuity is a **planning deliverable**, not a post-launch detail.
* If your current store has deeply indexed URLs, redirect planning should start early so priority URLs can be validated before go-live.

**Planning mindset**

Treat redirects like a “top journey protection list,” not a long spreadsheet you build at the end. In practice, most stores benefit from prioritizing:

* Best-selling product URLs
* Top category URLs
* High-traffic content or landing pages
* URLs tied to paid campaigns or external backlinks

#### 5) Search requirements and implications

Magento discovery is influenced by both attribute quality and how search is implemented/configure. Adobe Commerce 2.4 installations must be configured to use Elasticsearch or OpenSearch for catalog search. (Platform implementations can vary, so treat this as a dependency to confirm during planning.)

**Why it matters in a migration**

* Search and filtering outcomes depend on attribute quality and platform configuration, not only record counts.
* Early validation should include filtering and search behavior, not just product pages, because discovery can “pass counts” but still fail in real browsing workflows.

**A common pitfall to avoid**

Teams validate that the right number of products, categories, and customers exist, but do not validate whether:

* Key filters actually appear and work
* Search returns expected products for high-intent queries
* Category browsing feels consistent with how customers shop

Magento can look correct in totals while discovery is degraded if attributes, attribute sets, and search expectations were not validated early.

#### Conclusion

Magento’s strength is flexibility. Migration quality depends on deliberate mapping of product types, attributes, and store scope, plus early validation of SEO and search outcomes so catalog meaning survives the move.

Run a Demo Migration that includes your most attribute-heavy products, complex product types, and a realistic multi-store sample (if applicable). If you prefer, you can ask Next-Cart to run the Demo Migration using your sample data and share the results so you can confirm direction before committing to full scope.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Does your migration tool support transferring product relationships to Magento?</strong></summary>

Yes. Next-Cart supports migrating product relationships such as related products, cross-sells, and up-sells to Magento.

Validate these on representative products to confirm the storefront outcome matches expectations.

<summary><strong>Is it possible to migrate invoices to Magento?</strong></summary>

Yes. Next-Cart supports migrating invoices, shipments, and credit memos to Magento. If those entities are important to your operations, validate a small set of representative orders early.

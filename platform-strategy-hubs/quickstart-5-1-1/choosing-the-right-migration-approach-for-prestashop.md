# Choosing the Right Migration Approach for Square

Choosing a migration approach is less about preference and more about risk control. With OpenCart, risk often concentrates in extension-driven behavior, inconsistent product option structures, and the amount of validation work required to sign off confidently.

This guide helps you choose the safest Next-Cart approach for your OpenCart migration based on evidence from assessment, not assumptions. It also explains what changes and what stays the same across service models so you can plan responsibilities clearly.

### The decision framework: choose based on your highest risk

A reliable way to choose is to answer three questions:

#### 1) How complex is your OpenCart store in practice?

Complexity is rarely “number of products.” It is usually:

* how consistent product options are across the catalog
* how critical attributes and filtering are to discovery
* how curated category intent is
* how much behavior is driven by extensions or custom fields
* whether the store behaves like a “custom cart” due to custom development

#### 2) How much internal capacity do you have to operate migration and validate outcomes?

Approach choice should reflect:

* who will run migration operations and reruns
* who will validate results and sign off
* how quickly your team can review outcomes without delaying the timeline

#### 3) What is your tolerance for surprise close to go-live?

If your launch window is tight, your SEO risk is high, or you cannot afford operational disruption, it is usually safer to choose an approach that reduces execution and coordination risk.

### Standard Migration: best when you want control and complexity is predictable

#### What Standard Migration means

In Standard Migration, you run the migration tool yourself. Next-Cart experts provide guidance and assistance to help you configure and operate the tool correctly. You are responsible for operation and for validating outcomes.

#### Standard Migration is a strong fit when

* demo outcomes are consistent and explainable
* product options and attributes behave predictably in the sample
* extension-driven requirements are limited or non-critical
* your team has bandwidth to run tests, reruns, and validation
* you want hands-on control over timing and iteration

#### Watch-outs for OpenCart projects

Standard can become stressful if:

* you discover late that extension-driven behavior is critical
* the catalog has inconsistent option patterns that require extra mapping decisions
* validation workload is heavier than expected

Standard works best when you treat validation as a planned responsibility, not an afterthought.

### Managed Migration: best when execution bandwidth is your main constraint

#### What Managed Migration means

In Managed Migration, a Next-Cart expert executes the migration process on your behalf. Your primary responsibility is validating outcomes against your expectations.

#### Managed Migration is a strong fit when

* your team’s bandwidth is limited and you want fewer operational bottlenecks
* you want expert execution and a more controlled workflow
* your risks are mostly about process ownership and timeline stability
* your store is feasible within standard capabilities, but you do not want to run migration operations internally

#### Watch-outs for OpenCart projects

Managed migration reduces execution burden, but it does not remove the need for:

* clear non-negotiable outcomes
* representative samples for validation
* quick decision-making when mapping questions arise

Managed is safest when validation ownership is explicit and prioritized.

### Custom Migration: best when tool adaptation is required to preserve what matters

#### What Custom Migration means

Custom Migration is for stores with special requirements that require modifications to the migration tool. A Next-Cart technician implements one or more Custom Jobs, and a Next-Cart expert executes the migration. You validate the final result.

Custom Migration is best understood as: Managed Migration plus Custom Jobs.

#### Custom Migration is a strong fit when

* extension-driven data is business-critical
* custom fields must be preserved for conversion or operations
* special handling is required for consistent outcomes (such as defined filtering rules)
* your OpenCart store behaves like a “custom cart” due to custom development
* demo results show that standard capability cannot represent essential meaning

#### Watch-outs for OpenCart projects

Custom should be chosen intentionally based on evidence, not fear. The best trigger is when demo review confirms that business-critical outcomes cannot be preserved without custom handling.

### How to choose quickly using Demo Migration evidence

Use this lightweight decision table after Stage 1:

#### Choose Standard Migration when

* demo results are clean for complex option products
* attribute behavior remains usable for discovery
* category intent can be preserved with normal mapping decisions
* extension dependencies are limited or not needed after migration
* you can operate the tool and validate thoroughly

#### Choose Managed Migration when

* results are feasible within standard capability
* your main risk is internal bandwidth, coordination, or timeline
* you want expert execution while you focus on validation

#### Choose Custom Migration when

* business-critical outcomes depend on extension-driven data or custom fields
* you need special handling rules to preserve meaning consistently
* demo review indicates requirements that standard capability cannot handle

### What responsibilities do not change across approaches

Regardless of approach:

* validation and sign-off remains a customer responsibility
* you should define non-negotiable outcomes before go-live
* you should validate priority pathways first (best sellers, top categories, key order scenarios)
* 24/7 expert support is included

### Conclusion

The right OpenCart migration approach is the one that reduces your highest risk: execution ownership risk, validation bandwidth risk, or special-requirement risk. Standard Migration is strongest when you want control and your complexity is predictable. Managed Migration is strongest when your team needs expert execution to keep the process stable. Custom Migration is the safest choice when OpenCart extension-driven requirements or custom fields must be preserved through Custom Jobs. Use Demo Migration evidence to make the decision early, and your validation and go-live planning becomes dramatically more predictable.

If you want to choose the right OpenCart approach quickly, run a Demo Migration with best sellers that include complex options, attribute-heavy products used for filtering, and your top traffic categories. If you share the demo outcomes and your non-negotiable requirements via Live Chat, Next-Cart can help you classify gaps as mapping decisions, platform differences, or Custom Job needs, and recommend whether Standard, Managed, or Custom Migration is the safest path for your timeline.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I start with Standard and upgrade later if needed?</strong></summary>

Many projects start with a demo-based assumption, then adjust once real complexity is visible. The most efficient path is using a Demo Migration to surface scope early so the project does not rework decisions late.

<details>

<summary><strong>Do I have to decide the service model before running a Demo Migration?</strong></summary>

No. Demo Migration is designed to help you evaluate results and surface special handling needs first. The service model choice does not affect your Demo Migration experience, and demo outcomes are often the best input for choosing the safest approach.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What’s the difference between Managed Migration and Custom Migration?</strong></summary>

Managed Migration means a Next-Cart expert executes the migration for you and you validate outcomes. Custom Migration includes Managed execution plus one or more Custom Jobs that adapt the migration tool to special requirements. You still validate the final results.

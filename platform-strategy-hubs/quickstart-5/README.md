# PrestaShop Migration Hub

PrestaShop is often selected for its flexibility and structured catalog model, especially when product variations are expressed through attributes and combinations. Migration planning typically focuses on preserving the buying model and ensuring that variation behavior remains clear to shoppers.

#### What PrestaShop is good at (in a migration context)

* **Module-driven extensibility**, allowing migrated stores to rebuild key behaviors through selected modules.
* **Product combinations and attributes**, which shape how options become purchasable outcomes.
* **Multistore scope**, which impacts how catalogs and content vary across storefronts.
* **URL behavior and continuity tooling**, which must be planned deliberately to avoid SEO surprises.

#### What changes in a migration, at a glance

* **Modules and dependency risk:** critical store behavior may depend on modules that must be planned as part of scope.
* **Catalog combinations:** option logic can shift if combinations are not modeled intentionally.
* **Multistore scope rules:** you need clarity on what varies by store and what stays shared.
* **SEO and URL behavior:** URL continuity requires early planning and validation, not late patching.
* **Environment variability:** open-source flexibility means outcomes can vary by hosting and configuration.

#### How Next-Cart helps you reduce uncertainty

Next-Cart helps you validate the combination model early and interpret results based on shopper experience and operational usability. If restructuring is needed, it is better to know before full execution.

#### Conclusion

PrestaShop is often a strong target when your catalog depends on clear variation modeling and when attributes and combinations match how customers buy. Migration success depends on preserving variation meaning and validating the products that represent your complexity, not only your averages. When you validate combination behavior early and align your approval criteria with real buying paths, you reduce late surprises and protect launch readiness.

You can confirm direction through a **Demo Migration result** that includes your most combination-heavy products. If you prefer, you can **ask Next-Cart to run the Demo Migration using your sample data** and provide a structured results review. If your store has heavy combinations or you want help interpreting combination behavior or scoping multistore risk, Live Chat is the fastest path to expert guidance.

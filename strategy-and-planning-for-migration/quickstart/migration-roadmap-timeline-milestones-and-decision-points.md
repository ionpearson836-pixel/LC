# Migration Roadmap: Timeline, Milestones, and Decision Points

A shopping cart migration succeeds when it is planned like a project, not treated like a handoff. The work that protects outcomes happens before execution: defining scope, setting ownership, validating assumptions, and aligning on what “done” means.

This roadmap gives you a practical way to plan a migration timeline with clear milestones and decision points. It is designed to reduce late surprises, keep stakeholders aligned, and protect go-live confidence.

### The five phases of a migration roadmap

#### Phase 1: Discovery and scope clarity

Goal: understand what you are migrating, what must remain true after launch, and where complexity lives.

Key outputs:

* agreed data scope (what is in, what is out)
* high-risk areas identified (catalog complexity, SEO continuity, promotions, integrations)
* success criteria defined in business terms (conversion, operations, traffic continuity)

Decision points:

* whether scope is realistic for your target timeline
* whether you need Standard Migration, Managed Migration, or Custom Migration

#### Phase 2: Planning and ownership alignment

Goal: turn scope into an executable plan with owners, milestones, and acceptance criteria.

Key outputs:

* responsibilities defined (who owns validation, content, redirects, promotions, approvals)
* validation plan defined (what will be checked, by whom, and what “pass” means)
* go-live approach defined at a high level (cutover readiness and sign-off gates)

Decision points:

* what must be validated before execution begins
* what can be validated after launch with monitoring, without increasing unacceptable risk

#### Phase 3: Proof through sample validation

Goal: reduce uncertainty before full execution by validating representative samples.

Key outputs:

* sample results reviewed across functions (catalog behavior, navigation, accounts, orders, promos, priority pages)
* decisions captured for any meaning changes (what must stay identical vs what can change with communication)
* any required custom handling identified early

Decision points:

* whether the current plan is safe as-is
* whether scope, service model, or timeline must be adjusted

#### Phase 4: Full execution and quality checks

Goal: execute the migration work and verify outcomes against success criteria.

Key outputs:

* migrated data verified through outcome-based checks, not totals only
* gaps documented with owners and resolution decisions
* launch readiness assessed using a checklist mindset

Decision points:

* whether you have enough proof to proceed to go-live
* what issues are acceptable to defer versus must be resolved pre-launch

#### Phase 5: Go-live readiness and stabilization

Goal: launch with control and reduce post-launch risk through monitoring and fast issue detection.

Key outputs:

* go-live sign-off gates completed
* priority pathways monitored (traffic entry pages, top categories, checkout outcomes, key promos)
* early issues triaged with clear ownership

Decision points:

* when to declare stabilization complete
* what improvements are planned as post-launch iteration versus urgent fixes

### Milestones that reduce risk the most

#### Milestone: Scope lock for what matters most

You do not need perfect scope, but you do need clarity on the high-impact parts of the store:

* best sellers and highest-traffic categories
* customer account expectations
* order history needs
* SEO continuity priorities (URLs, priority pages)
* promotion scenarios that drive revenue

#### Milestone: Validation sample approved by stakeholders

A migration plan is only as strong as the sample you validate. The sample should be representative enough that stakeholders trust the results.

#### Milestone: Acceptance criteria defined in outcomes

Examples of outcome-based acceptance criteria:

* shoppers can find and buy best sellers with correct variants and pricing
* customers can be recognized and guided through a clear login outcome
* priority landing pages remain reachable and intent-consistent
* key promotions behave as expected in real carts

#### Milestone: Go-live gate with named sign-off owners

Go-live is safer when sign-off is explicit:

* who signs off catalog behavior
* who signs off SEO continuity priorities
* who signs off promotions
* who signs off support readiness

### The decision points that teams regret delaying

#### Choosing a service approach without proof

Choosing the service model early without sample validation often leads to a later scramble. Complexity signals should drive the decision, not optimism.

#### Launch date set before scope and ownership are clear

Dates are easiest to set and hardest to honor. A date set before scope clarity often becomes pressure that creates unsafe shortcuts.

#### Treating validation as “a final check”

Validation is not a final task. It is a workstream. If validation ownership and criteria are not planned, “testing” becomes informal and late.

Expert insight: Most migration timeline failures are not caused by the migration work itself. They are caused by late discovery of complexity and missing ownership for proof.

### How to keep the roadmap practical

* Define a priority set of outcomes instead of trying to perfect everything.
* Validate early with representative samples so decisions are evidence-based.
* Assign owners to proof, not just tasks.
* Treat go-live as a gate that requires named sign-off, not a date you hope to hit.

### Conclusion

A migration roadmap is a risk management tool disguised as a timeline. The teams that launch confidently are not the ones who move fastest. They are the ones who make the right decisions early: scope clarity, ownership, evidence through validation, and explicit go-live gates. When your roadmap is built around proof instead of assumptions, the migration becomes predictable and the launch becomes controlled.

If you want a roadmap that reflects your store’s real complexity, start by defining a representative validation sample and the acceptance criteria you need to sign off go-live.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>How long does a shopping cart migration usually take?</strong></summary>

It depends on scope, complexity, and validation requirements. Timelines are usually driven more by decision-making, ownership, and proof cycles than by the data transfer itself.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What are the most important milestones before go-live?</strong></summary>

Scope clarity for priority outcomes, a representative validation sample with reviewed results, defined acceptance criteria, and a go-live gate with named sign-off owners.

<summary><strong>When should we decide between Standard Migration, Managed Migration, and Custom Migration?</strong></summary>

Ideally after you identify complexity signals and validate a representative sample. Early proof helps you choose the safest approach without guessing.
